# AI-Based Code Debugger – Frontend

 Just uploaded the frontend of my AI-based Code Debugger for Developers!

This is a small step, but every commit brings me closer to building something meaningful for the dev community. The frontend is designed to interact with an upcoming AI/NLP-based backend that will detect and explain code errors.

## Technologies Used
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- Python (for backend – coming soon)

## Future Goals
- Integrate AI model for bug detection
- Add code explanation and suggestions
- Make it open-source friendly

I’d love your feedback and ideas! Let’s build something amazing together.
